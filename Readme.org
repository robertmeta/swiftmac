** Helper Scripts and Tools
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: helper-scripts-and-tools
:END:

SwiftMac includes several helper tools to make configuration easier.

*** Voice Configuration Tools

**** list-voices.el - Interactive Voice Browser

Interactive Emacs tool to browse and sample all installed voices.

Load it in your Emacs config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-file "/path/to/swiftmac/list-voices.el")
#+END_SRC

Run =M-x swiftmac-list-voices= to open an interactive buffer showing:
- All voices grouped by quality (Premium/Enhanced/Compact)
- Organized by locale (en_US, en_GB, etc.)

Keybindings:
- =RET= or =s= - Sample the voice at point
- =x= - Stop all speaking
- =g= - Refresh the list
- =q= - Quit

**** download-premium-voices.sh - Voice Installation Helper

Lists all available premium and enhanced voices with installation instructions.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ./scripts/download-premium-voices.sh          # Show available voices
  ./scripts/download-premium-voices.sh verify   # Verify installed voices
#+END_SRC

To download voices:

1. Open System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content
2. Click the INFO BUTTON (ⓘ) next to 'System Voice'
3. Search for 'premium' or 'enhanced'
4. Download only the voices you'll use (each is 50-300MB)

**** show-voices.swift - List All Voices

Quick script to list all available voices with quality levels:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  swift scripts/show-voices.swift
#+END_SRC

Output includes language, identifier, name, and quality level (1=Compact, 2=Enhanced, 3=Premium).

**** Voice Configuration Examples

**Default Configuration (swiftmac-voices.el)**

The =swiftmac-voices.el= file is the standard voice configuration that ships with Emacspeak. It provides:
- Default voice definitions
- CSS voice mapping (for rich text rendering)
- Integration with Emacspeak's voice lock system

This file is automatically loaded when you select the swiftmac server.

**English (Premium + Enhanced)**

The repo includes =voices-config-english.el= which uses:
- Premium voices (Quality 3) for main text reading
- Enhanced voices (Quality 2) for highlights/annotations

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-file "/path/to/swiftmac/voices-config-english.el")
#+END_SRC

**Polish**

The repo includes =voices-config-polish.el= for Polish voices:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-file "/path/to/swiftmac/voices-config-polish.el")
#+END_SRC

**Markdown Reading**

The =markdown-voices-config.el= provides optimized voice settings for reading Markdown files.

**Custom Voice Configuration**

Example of defining your own voices:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (swiftmac-define-voice voice-bolden "[{voice en-US:Evan}] [[pitch 1]]")
  (swiftmac-define-voice voice-animate "[{voice en-US:Ava (Premium)}] [[pitch 1]]")
  (swiftmac-define-voice voice-lighten "[{voice en-AU:Matilda}] [[pitch 1.1]]")
  (swiftmac-define-voice voice-smoothen "[{voice en-US:Zoe (Premium)}] [[pitch 0.8]]")
#+END_SRC

*** Audio Volume Control

Control volume levels for different audio types (values between 0.0 and 1.0):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_TONE_VOLUME" "0.1")      ; Beeps and tones
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SOUND_VOLUME" "0.1")     ; Sound effects
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_VOICE_VOLUME" "1.0")     ; Speech
#+END_SRC

*** Audio Device Tools

**** list-audio-devices.swift - Find Audio Device IDs

Lists all available audio output devices with their IDs and channel counts:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  swift scripts/list-audio-devices.swift
  # or
  make list-devices
#+END_SRC

Example output:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[DEFAULT] DeviceID: 125 | "Audioengine D1" | Channels: 2
          DeviceID: 110 | "LG Ultra HD" | Channels: 2
          DeviceID: 89 | "MacBook Pro Speakers" | Channels: 2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Use these device IDs for multi-device routing configuration (see below).

*** Example Configuration Files

The repository includes several example configurations:

- =init.el-example.el= - Example Emacspeak initialization
- =minimal-emacspeak-init.el= - Minimal working Emacspeak config
- =markdown-voices-config.el= - Voice configuration for reading Markdown files
- =simple-device-test.el= - Basic device routing test
- =simple-device-switch.el= - Example of switching audio devices
- =test-notifications.el= - Test notification routing

These are primarily for testing and development, but can be useful as configuration examples.

*** Testing and Development Files

If you're developing or debugging SwiftMac:

**Shell Test Scripts:**
- =scripts/test-clean-emacspeak.sh= - Test with clean Emacspeak environment
- =scripts/test-dual-mode.sh= - Test dual-process mode
- =scripts/test-multi-device.sh= - Test multi-device routing
- =scripts/test-multiple-instances.sh= - Test multiple SwiftMac instances
- =scripts/test-proper-dual.sh= - Test proper dual-mode setup

**Emacs Test Files:**
- =device-test-with-stop.el= - Device testing with stop commands
- =test-audio-routing.el= - Audio routing tests
- =test-runtime-device-switching.el= - Runtime device switch tests
- =test-simple-routing.el= - Simple routing tests

** Multi-Device and Channel Routing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: multi-device-and-channel-routing
:END:

SwiftMac supports routing different audio types to different physical devices AND channels. All four audio types can be independently configured:
- Speech (main spoken output)
- Notifications (auditory icons/beeps)
- Tones (generated tones)
- Sound effects (played audio files)

*** Finding Your Device IDs

Run this to list available audio output devices:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make list-devices
#+END_SRC

Example output:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[DEFAULT] DeviceID: 125 | "Audioengine D1" | Channels: 2
          DeviceID: 110 | "LG Ultra HD" | Channels: 2
          DeviceID: 89 | "MacBook Pro Speakers" | Channels: 2
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Configuration Format

Set environment variables in your Emacs init file (BEFORE loading emacspeak):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_<TYPE>_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "<deviceID>:<channel>")
#+END_SRC

Where:
- =<TYPE>=: SPEECH, NOTIFICATION, TONE, or SOUNDEFFECT
- =<deviceID>=: Numeric ID from =make list-devices= (or 0 for system default)
- =<channel>=: left, right, or both

*** Example Configurations

**** All Audio to One Device (Simple Setup)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ; Everything to Audioengine D1, stereo
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SPEECH_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_NOTIFICATION_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_TONE_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SOUNDEFFECT_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
#+END_SRC

**** Separate Devices for Speech and Notifications
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ; Speech to headphones, notifications to monitor speakers
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SPEECH_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")  ; Audioengine D1
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_NOTIFICATION_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "110:both")  ; LG Ultra HD
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_TONE_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SOUNDEFFECT_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "110:both")

  ; IMPORTANT: Enable notification server for multi-device routing
  (setopt tts-notification-device "left")
#+END_SRC

**** Same Device, Different Channels
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ; Speech in both ears, notifications in left ear only
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SPEECH_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_NOTIFICATION_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:left")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_TONE_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SOUNDEFFECT_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:left")

  (setopt tts-notification-device "left")  ; Enable notification server
#+END_SRC

**** All Four Audio Types to Different Outputs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ; Maximum separation for complex audio setups
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SPEECH_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "125:both")  ; Speech -> Audioengine D1
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_NOTIFICATION_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "110:left")  ; Notifications -> LG left
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_TONE_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "89:both")  ; Tones -> MacBook speakers
  (setenv "SWIFTMAC_SOUNDEFFECT_DEVICE_AND_CHANNEL" "110:right")  ; Sounds -> LG right

  (setopt tts-notification-device "left")  ; Enable notification server
#+END_SRC

*** Runtime Channel Commands

Change ONLY the channel (not device) on the fly:

- =tts_set_speech_channel {left|right|both}=
- =tts_set_notification_channel {left|right|both}=

Note: Runtime device switching (changing the physical device) is not yet supported. Restart Emacs to change devices.

*** How Multi-Device Routing Works

Emacspeak spawns two separate swiftmac processes:
1. *Speech process* (main): Handles regular speech output
2. *Notification process*: Handles auditory icons and notifications

The =tts-notification-device= setting triggers Emacspeak to spawn the second process with =SWIFTMAC_AUDIO_TARGET= set, which swiftmac detects as notification mode.

Each process reads its own device configuration from the environment variables, allowing speech and notifications to output to different physical devices.

For more details, see =MULTI-DEVICE-SETUP.md=.

** Introduction 

This is an emacspeak server written in swift intended to be as async as 
reasonable, fast and responsive.

Unless you are a developer or interested in becoming one, you probably 
want to use the version bundled with emacspeak, I keep that copy up to 
date with this one fairly consistently. 

** Hacking
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hacking
:END:

The recommended workflow is to symlink the swiftmac binary under either
.build/release/swiftmac or ./build/debug/swiftmac (depending which you are building) to your emacspeak servers directory.

*** Common Make Commands

Build commands:
#+begin_src shell
make              # Build debug version
make debug        # Same as above
make release      # Build optimized release version
#+end_src

Utility commands:
#+begin_src shell
make list-devices # List audio output devices with IDs
make update-ogg   # Update OggDecoder dependency to latest version
make tidy         # Format all source files (Swift, shell, Emacs Lisp)
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
make super-nuke   # Deep clean including caches
#+end_src

The =make tidy= command formats all source files in the repository:
- *Swift files*: Uses =swift-format= (install: =brew install swift-format=)
- *Shell scripts (.sh)*: Uses =shfmt= with 2-space indentation (install: =brew install shfmt=)
- *Emacs Lisp files (.el)*: Uses Emacs batch mode for indentation

If any formatter is not installed, it will skip that file type and show installation instructions.

Installation:
#+begin_src shell
make install         # Install release version to $EMACSPEAK_DIR
make install-debug   # Install debug version to $EMACSPEAK_DIR
#+end_src

Testing:
#+begin_src shell
make test-emacs         # Test with debug build
make test-emacs-release # Test with release build
#+end_src

I will likely remove make install in the future, as it is a bit fidgety, but I
will leave it in for now. 

** Having Trouble?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: having-trouble
:END:

*** It emits warnings and notes

I am aware of the current warnings, it is a goal to get it to build completely 
clean but tthat is not a priority right now, getting to v2 is the priority.

*** Double-Speaking

If you are hearing stuff twice, ensure that mac-ignore-accessibility is set 
and your emacs version supports it. If that doesn't work, you can use the 
VoiceOver Utility that comes with MacOS to create an activity for Emacs.app 
to turn off voiceover while in the Emacs window.  This only works if you are
using a windowed version of Emacs (not terminal version). 

** Design

The server intends to provide primitives to support all the features used by
emacspeak and swiftmac-voices.el.


*** Supported Commands

These are the commands sent via stdin and on thier own line.

- =a=: queue audio icon
- =c=: queue code
- =d=: dispatch queue
- =l=: instant letter
- =p=: instant audio icon
- =q=: queue speech
- =s=: stop all (confirm with list)_

- =tts_set_tone_volume=: 0 to 1 (1 being 100% tone volume)
- =tts_set_voice=: queue voice change
- =tts_set_voice_volume=: 0 to 1 (1 being 100% voice volume)

Broken:
- =tts_allcaps_beep=: queue caps beep change, setting only works on typing
  input


*** Supported Embeddings

These are converted by the preprocessor into tts_ commands.

- [*] - queue silence in place of this

** Goals

1. The server should be as dumb as possible.
2. Major decisions should be configurable in lisp.
3. System should be "usable by default" meaing:
   once it builds, it works.
4. Server will depend on only clearly defined and 
   checked at compile time things. No secret deps
   on command line tools.
